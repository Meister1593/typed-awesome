# typed-awesome

This repository contains declarations for Awesome Window Manager.
The goal of this project is to enable people write their own dotfiles for AwesomeWM in typescript with additional type-safety and IDE tools.

Current state of declarations is very, very early pre-alpha and should not be considered feature-complete at all.
As time goes on, new declarations will be added to this repository.
